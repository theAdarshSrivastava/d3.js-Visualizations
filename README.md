# India Population Visualizations

As we know there are so many states and union territories present in India and all of them have their respective population so we are trying to create a proportional symbol map in which the circle size depends upon the population of the respective region.

# Problem Statement

## CARTOGRAPHY - D3.JS
This question is related to our class topic - geospatial visualization. Your task is to create a proportional
symbol map (see lecture slides for definition), as follows.
1. Generate a map of India from this link: http://geojson.io/#map=2/20.0/0.0
2. Generate coordinates (latitude and longitude) for different states. You can find the states and the
population information here https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_states_and_union_
territories_of_India_by_population.
3. Create a proportional symbol map from the data by drawing RED circles on the generated coordinates.
The radii of the circles must be proportional to the population of the states.
